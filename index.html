<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>
    The third edition of "Learning and Automata" (LearnAut) will be held at <a href="https://lics.siglog.org/lics19/">LICS 2019</a> in Vancouver (Canada) on June 23, 2019.
</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>
    Grammatical Inference (GI) studies machine learning algorithms for models defining recursive computations like automata and grammars.
    The expressive power of this kind of models and the complexity of associated computational problems are a major research topic within the LICS community.
    Historically, there has been very little interaction between the GI and LICS communities, though in recent years we have seen some important results starting to bridge the gap between both worlds, including applications of learning to formal verification and model checking, and (co-)algebraic formulations of automata and grammar learning algorithms.
</p>

<p>
    The goal of this workshop is to bring together experts on logic that could benefit from grammatical inference tools, and researchers in grammatical inference who could find in logic and verification new applications for their methods.
</p>

<h2>Content</h2>
<p>
    The LearnAut workshop will consists of a number of invited talks, other talks from researchers who submitted their work to the workshop, and discussions.
    An important amount of time will be kept for interactions between participants.
</p>

<p>
    Similarly to how main machine learning conferences and workshops are organized, all accepted abstracts will be part of a poster session held during the workshop.
    Additionally, the Program Committee will select a subset of the abstracts for oral presentation.
    At least one author of each accepted abstract is expected to represent it at the workshop.
